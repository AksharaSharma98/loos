<h2><a class="anchor" name="Introduction">
Introduction</a></h2>
Welcome to the LOOS library, a product of the Grossfield Lab at the University of Rochester Medical School and the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics. The idea behind LOOS is to provide a lightweight C++ library for analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. This includes parsing a number of PDB variants, as well as the native system description and trajectory formats for CHARMM, NAMD, and Amber. LOOS is not intended to be an all-encompassing library and it is primarily geared towards reading data in and processing rather than manipulating the files and structures and writing them out.<p>
LOOS operates mainly on groups of atoms, called an AtomicGroup. The atoms are stored as Boost shared pointers, so multiple groups can contain the same atom without having to actually copy it. This does mean that you should be careful though when modifying an atom since you may be affecting multiple groups in potentially unknown ways.<p>
For assistance using LOOS, to suggest a patch, to request a feature, or simply to offer positive feedback, email LOOS-maintainer [AT] urmc.rochester.edu. The latest version of LOOS can be found at <a href="http://loos.sourceforge.net">http://loos.sourceforge.net</a>.<p>
<b> Important information regarding the latest changes are available here:</b> <a class="el" href="changes.html">Change Log</a><h2><a class="anchor" name="Features">
Features</a></h2>
One of the features of LOOS is the multiple ways it supports atom selection. AtomicGroup objects can create subsets of themselves by using an AtomSelector (a predicate). There are several useful ones already pre-defined, such as CAlphaSelector and SolventSelector. These can even be combined with logical operations. The SolventSelector is actually written this way.<p>
Alternatively, LOOS supports selections created from user-input. LOOS can parse a selection string (in a format based on C expression syntax) and use this for picking atoms. For example, it's trivial to write you tool so that a user can pick which atoms to consider at run-time with a string like: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
(resid &gt;= 10 &amp;&amp; resid &lt;= 100) &amp;&amp; (segid == "PROT" || segid == "HEME") &amp;&amp; !(name =~ "H")
</pre></div> which picks atoms with resid's between 10 and 100, a segid of either "HEME" or "PROT", and all non-hydrogen atoms. PERL-style regular expressions are also supported using the "=~" operator.<p>
More information is available here: <a class="el" href="selections.html">Selection Language</a><h2><a class="anchor" name="Applications">
Applications</a></h2>
Although LOOS is primarily intended as a platform for developing analysis tools,it is distributed with a number of prebuilt applications, located in the Tools/ directory. These tools were developed for use in our research, but they should be of general utility. Moreover, they provide examples of the intended use of the LOOS library, and will probably make helpful templates for people looking to develop new tools.<p>
For more information, see the <a class="el" href="tools.html">Tools page</a><h2><a class="anchor" name="Bugs">
Bugs</a></h2>
There are none...only features. So don't worry about them! Email us directly (LOOS-maintainer [AT] urmc.rochester.edu) if you find a bug^H^H^H unintended feature.<h2><a class="anchor" name="build">
Building and Installing</a></h2>
LOOS requires <a href="http://www.scons.org" target="_blank">SCons</a> to build. It also requires the vecLib framework and Developer's Tools for OS X or <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Atlas</a> for Linux. It also requires the <a href="http://boost.org" target="_blank">Boost</a> libraries for both (including the regular expression library). If you plan to modify the parser (you probably don't), you'll need the GNU utilities <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/">flex</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">bison</a>. Similarly, if you want to rebuild the documentation, you'll need to install Doxygen.<p>
If your libraries are installed in non-standard locations, you may need to tell LOOS where its required components are. To do this, do the following: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
cp custom.py-proto custom.py
</pre></div> Then edit your <code>custom.py</code> file to tell SCons and LOOS where your libraries are.<h3><a class="anchor" name="build_fedora">
Building with Fedora</a></h3>
We recommend you use the the <code>yum</code> tool that comes with Fedora to install the required packages. You will need, at a minimum, to install atlas, boost, and SCons. Fedora splits many packages into the libraries necessary to run and the libraries and headers necessary for development. You will need to be sure to install the development versions as well, i.e. <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
yum install boost.x86_64
yum install boost-devel.x86_64
</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" name="build_ubunto">
Building with Ubuntu</a></h3>
You will need to install atlas, boost, and SCons. LOOS has been tested with <code>atlas3-sse2-devel</code> and <code>boost-devel</code> installed under the latest Ubuntu. You should not need to use a custom.py.<h3><a class="anchor" name="build_other">
Building with MacOS X</a></h3>
You will need to download and install boost and SCons. You may also want to install Doxygen if you want a local copy of the documentation. You will also need to create a <code>custom.py</code> file to tell LOOS where to find the libraries and headers that it needs. Copy the <code>custom.py-proto</code> to <code>custom.py</code> and edit it. In particular, look at the <code>BOOSTREGEX</code> and <code>BOOSTPO</code> variables for the boost regular expression library and program options libraries. You will most likely need to change these names...<h3><a class="anchor" name="compiling">
Compiling</a></h3>
You can temporarily override the defaults (and what's set in your <code>custom.py</code> file by specifying the appropriate variables on the command-line (run <code>scons</code> <code>-h</code> for more information)<p>
To build just the library, cd to the top-level directory and run SCons: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
cd /path/to/LOOS
scons lib
</pre></div><p>
To build the library and tools as well, use:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
scons
</pre></div><p>
For more detailed information about the build process, see <a class="el" href="building.html">Building LOOS</a><p>
To install LOOS, use the "install" target:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
scons install
</pre></div><p>
This will cause SCons to copy the headers, tools, and library into /opt/loos. You can change where LOOS is installed by changing the PREFIX variable in either your custom.py file or on the command line. LOOS will create a /bin, /include, /lib, and /docs directory and copy the appropriate files. The recommended installation methodology is to install LOOS into a version-specific directory, and then set up a symlink from <code>loos-latest</code> to the most recent installed version: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
scons PREFIX=/opt/loos-1.5.4 install
ln -s /opt/loos-1.5.4 /opt/loos-latest
</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" name="BYO">
Building Your Own Tools</a></h3>
To use LOOS, you will want to include the top-level LOOS directory in both your include path and your library paths, so something like the following for linux <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
g++ -o mytool mytool.cpp -I/opt/loos/include -L/opt/loos/lib -lloos -lboost_regex -llapack -latlas
</pre></div> or the following for OS X <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
g++ -framework vecLib -o mytool mytool.cpp -I/opt/loos/include -L/opt/loos/lib -lloos -lboost_regex
</pre></div><p>
Keep in mind that the above lines may be greatly oversimplified... You will almost certainly need to change the names of the libraries to reflect the versions you have installed, as well as the directories for the header files. This can get quite messy. As such, we strongly recommend you use either the <code>SConstruct/SConscript</code> or the <code>Makefile</code> in the <em>Examples</em> directory as a template for building your own tools.<h2><a class="anchor" name="future">

<ul>
<li>
Support for other simulation packages (Gromacs, etc)<p>
</li>
<li>
Python bindings for easier scripting support </li>
