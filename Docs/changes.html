Version 1.5.4 (4-19-2010)</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r154_added_changed">
Added, Changed, or otherwise Notable</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Changed contact-time to use "fast" method that uses a distance-cutoff to restrict which target atoms are considered. This can be disabled if necessary. See "contact-time --help" for more details. </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in DescendingSort that caused it to sort ascending instead. </li>
<li>
Changed porcupine tool to make tagging of altered atoms optional and to have fixed length tips rather than proportional length ones. </li>
<li>
Changed AtomicGroup::rmsd() to take a const arg (this means that it no longer implicitly sorts the AtomicGroup objects). Implicit sorting is one "feature" that is going to gradually go away from AtomicGroup. </li>
<li>
Changed VSA/ANM tools so as to allow user-defined HCA parameters </li>
<li>
Fixed Hessian code (affecting ANM/VSA) to truncate negative spring constants to 0 (generally, this happens when using HCA with nodes that are too close together). </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in parser for Debian systems </li>
<li>
Changed Linux code to use blas rather than cblas </li>
<li>
Changes made to SConstruct for better Ubuntu/SUSE support </li>

/*!<h2><a class="anchor" name="release153">
Version 1.5.3 (2-19-2010)</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r153_added_changed">
Added, Changed, or otherwise Notable</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
PDB::fromAtomicGroup() now generates a UnitCell if the passed AtomicGroup has periodic boundary information. This means that the output PDB will have a CRYST1 record. </li>
<li>
Added a more flexible centering tool called center-molecule </li>
<li>
Added a new tool for computing inter-selection contacts over time called contact-time </li>
<li>
Changed exposure tool to default to reimaging </li>
<li>
Added alignto tool for aligning a trajectory to a reference structure </li>
<li>
Added a set of generic sorting functions </li>
<li>
Added support for single and double precision matrix operations. Note that these are for "quick-and-dirty" work and are not meant to give good performance... </li>
<li>
ENM tools sort their output from smallest to largest eigenvalue, and the zero eigenpairs always come first </li>
<li>
Added a VSA tool (along with psf-masses and heavy-ca tools for getting mass information into the VSA tool) </li>
<li>
Added covariance and subspace overlap functions </li>
<li>
Changed DCDWriter so that it can now append to an existing DCD </li>
<li>
Changed ENM tools use a Hessian constructor that's in a separate module, along with different methods for handling the spring constants via a polymorphic "superblock" object pointer... This will make more sense looking at the code itself... </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r153_bugs">
Bug Fixes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed bugs in subsetter affecting reimaging only occuring if centering was turned on, and one causing bonds not to be cleared when subsetting. </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in extractCoords() causing it to always fail. </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in enmovie tool affecting connectivity not being cleared and atom number mismatches between the reference PDB and the DCD. </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in svd function that takes a vector&lt;AtomicGroup&gt;, but only when aligning was requested. The alignment transform was doubly-applied to the passed vector. No tools were affected by this. No other invocations of svd() were affected either. </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in aligner where the target selection was not always correctly centered. It would be aligned correctly, just not always centered...<p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
Fixed another issue with Amber restart files that may have slight variations in formatting. This affected restart files that only have the number of atoms in the header rather than the number of atoms and the time. </li>

<h2><a class="anchor" name="release151">
Version 1.5.1 (9-21-2009)</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r151_bugs">

<ul>
<li>
Fixed bug in install target where <a class="el" href="trr_8hpp-source.html">trr.hpp</a> was not copied to the installation directory. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="release150">
Version 1.5.0 (9-17-2009)</a></h2>
Many of the changes in this version are internal (primarily as new functions and features). The big change is that LOOS now supports Gromacs .gro, .trr, and .xtc file formats. Since Gromacs stores coordinates in nm, LOOS converts the coordinates into Angstroms upon reading. LOOS only supports single precision .xtc files.<p>
<em>Important note regarding Gromacs support: While we have tested the gromacs support with a limited set of sample files, the code has not been as rigorously tested as support for previous formats have been. Gromacs support should therefore be considered experimental at this stage. Please report any problems or errors to as at loos_maintainer [at] urmc.rochester.edu</em><p>
LOOS now also uses the hybrid-36 encoding method for PDB files with a large number of atoms or residues. See <a href="http://cci.lbl.gov/hybrid_36">here</a> for more information.<h3><a class="anchor" name="r150_added_changed">

<li>
Changes to the Trajectory class and subclasses: <ul>
<li>

<li>
Implementation functions are now private. </li>
<li>
Added some missing constructors in the subclasses. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Added some utilities for parsing strings (<a class="el" href="namespaceloos.html#7585779a474911fb422ac94d1a98a264" title="Extracts a field from a string.">loos::parseStringAs&lt;&gt;()</a>) </li>
<li>
Added new formatters for matrix output that make it easier to set the width and precision of the matrix elements, or write them out in scientific notation (i.e. <a class="el" href="classloos_1_1_scientific_matrix_formatter.html" title="Generic matrix element formatter using scientific notation...">loos::ScientificMatrixFormatter</a>) </li>

<li>
subsetter can now reimage </li>
<li>
SVD now will only write out the non-zero terms of the SVD rather than the entire matrix. </li>
<li>
Added a "not" operator to the selection language so there's no more fighting with the shell over '!'. </li>
<li>
Some tools have been updated internally to be more consistent with the current LOOS idioms... There may be minor changes in usage: <ul>
<li>
SVD now requires a 1 or 0 for the -S option </li>

</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="release140">
Version 1.4.0 (6-26-2009)</a></h2>
There has been a change in philosophy of how LOOS handles system descriptions vs models/trajectories/coordinates. Previously, LOOS would try to create an AtomicGroup that had complete information, such as when given an Amber prmtop file. In this case, LOOS would go looking for a file with the same name ending in ".inpcrd" and load this in with the prmtop file. Now, LOOS will treat coordinate files as a special trajectory that has only one frame. This way, most tools that can operate over a trajectory can also operate on a single model, and vice versa. For example, the following are all valid: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
ramachandran --pseuo foo.prmtop foo.rst all
ramachandran --pseudo foo.prmtop foo.mdcrd all
ramachandran foo.psf foo.dcd all
ramachandran foo.psf foo.pdb all
ramachandran foo.pdb foo.pdb all
</pre></div><p>
This can lead to the somewhat awkward usage in the last example, but think of it as the first PDB provides the system description and the second provides the actual model, even though they're both the same.<h3><a class="anchor" name="r140_added_changed">

<li>
"flucc2b" maps anm/gnm fluctuations onto a PDB's B-values </li>

<li>
Added an install target for SCons </li>
<li>
Added support for building a shared-library version of LOOS </li>
<li>
Added a special SCons check for ubuntu. Some systems appear to have an issue where they require the gfortran lib to be explicitly linked. If this causes an issue for you, simply comment out the ubuntu check in the SConstruct. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r140_internal">
Internal Changes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Changed how Trajectory classes work slightly... Trajectory-derived classes must now read in and cache the first frame of the trajectory as part of their initialization. </li>
<li>
CAlphaSelector() is now deprecated; use AtomNameSelector("CA") instead. </li>
<li>
Added a set of classes for providing user-feedback when a tool may take some time to execute. See <a class="el" href="classloos_1_1_progress_counter.html" title="The progress counter front-end.">loos::ProgressCounter</a> for more information, and the rmsds tool for an example of how to use the new classes. </li>
<li>
Removed the use of BOOST_FOREACH. This solves a compatability issue with older versions of BOOST and LOOS. </li>
<li>
Added a number of support utilities for reading in whole trajectories and reading in specific frames. </li>
<li>
The ensemble functions (i.e. align and average) can now operate over a user-specified set of frames from a trajectory. </li>
<li>
Added AtomicGroup::splitByResidue() that splits up a group by residue (based on changes in resid and/or segid), returning a vector&lt;AtomicGroup&gt;. </li>
<li>
The createSystem factory function now no longer tries to automatically find and import an Amber coord file when reading in a PRMTOP. In addition, the Amber::readCoords() function has been removed. </li>
<li>
Added support for Amber restart and coord files as a special 1-frame trajectory. This is transparently handled by the createTrajectory factory function. </li>
<li>
The Trajectory class now uses NVI for the seek and rewind member functions so it can impose some pre-conditions. This means the Trajectory base class handles the cached_first flag. Unless you're writing your own trajectory class, this wont affect you. If you are, it means the seek and rewind functions are now handled by rewindImpl(), seekImpl(), etc.<p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="anchor" name="r134_bugs">
Bug Fixes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed bug in aligner affecting centering the trajectory while using different alignment and transformation subsets. The output trajectory was incorrectly transformed. The error committed is proportional to the difference in the centroids between the two subsets... </li>

Version 1.3.3 (2-9-2009)</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r133_added_changed">
Added, Changed, or Notables</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Added recenter-trj tool to center trajectories </li>
<li>
Added trajinfo tool to print out information about generic trajectories. This tool will also verify the number of frames actually present in the trajectory. </li>
<li>
Added concat-selection tool to concatenate atoms from a trajectory into a single PDB. This is useful for visualization atom distributions over the entire trajectory </li>
<li>
Added blurrogram.pl, a PERL script to aid in creating "blurrogram" figures using Pymol </li>
<li>
Added AtomicGroup::translate() </li>
<li>
The frame2pdb tool now accepts a selection (subset) to write out </li>
<li>
The svd tool always writes out an average structure now </li>
<li>
The subsetter tool can now accept a list of aribtrary ranges of frames to extract, or a stride option. It can also take an arbitrary list of input trajectories to combine and extract from. In addition, it can override or add periodic box information. </li>
<li>
The DCD class will now handle reading of non-native endian DCD files </li>
<li>
The DCDWriter class will now flush the output streams after each frame is written to ensure all data is actually written to disk </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r133_bugs">
Bug Fixes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed an issue with DCD's written by LOOS that have periodic boundary information. The default unit cell angles were 1, rather than 90 degrees. This prevents programs like VMD from correctly displaying the periodic images. </li>
<li>
Fixed a typo in the default alignment selection for the rmsd2ref tool </li>
<li>
Fixed a bug in several tools that affected using a PSF file for the model when writing out a PDB file that had been subset with a selection. </li>
<li>
The <a class="el" href="namespaceloos.html#be25ba2b9027123aca28176782570862" title="Compute the average structure of a set of AtomicGroup objects.">loos::averageStructure()</a> function did not verify that the input vector&lt;XForm&gt; matches the numbef of frames in the passed trajectory. This results in a segmentation fault when the trajectory has a bad header (i.e. the number of frames listed does not reflect the number of frames actually in the trajectory). This case is now checked for and a slightly more sensible error is thrown. </li>
<li>
The error messages given when the LOOS could not decide what format a file is in were vague...this has been improved... </li>

<h2><a class="anchor" name="release130">
Version 1.3.0 (12-22-2008)</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r130_namespace">
Namespace Changes</a></h3>
This release represents some major changes to the internal structure of LOOS. First and foremost, virtually all of LOOS is now encapsulated within the "loos" namespace whereas before much of <a class="el" href="namespaceloos.html" title="Namespace for most things not already encapsulated within a class.">loos</a> was in the global namespace. This means that <code>Atom a;</code> becomes <code><a class="el" href="classloos_1_1_atom.html" title="Basic Atom class for handling atom properties.">loos::Atom</a> a;</code>. Alternatively, you can place a using directive at the top of your code, <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="keyword">using namespace </span>loos;

Atom a;
</pre></div><p>
LOOS also now respects your global namespace by not forcing the importation of names that it uses, such as from the <code>std</code> namespace or <code>boost</code>. In fact, in versions prior to 1.3.0, LOOS would import <code>std</code> into the global namespace. If you were relying on this behavior, you will now need to manually import in your code. We therefore recommend that you add the following to the start of all of your code: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="keyword">using namespace </span>std;
<span class="keyword">using namespace </span>loos;
</pre></div><p>
Another <b>major</b> change in version 1.3.0 is the matrix handling code. There is now a generic <code><a class="el" href="classloos_1_1_math_1_1_matrix.html" title="Simple matrix template class using policy classes to determine behavior.">loos::Math::Matrix</a></code> class that supports several different ways of laying out the raw data (i.e. row major vs column major) and can even support sparse storage. This class in in the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceloos_1_1_math.html" title="Namespace for math and math-related things in loos.">loos::Math</a></code> namespace. It is important to note that the goal of this class is to provide a controllable wrapper around a block of memory for interfacing with ATLAS. It is not meant to be a generic matrix in a mathematical sense, despite being located in the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceloos_1_1_math.html" title="Namespace for math and math-related things in loos.">loos::Math</a></code> namespace. The polymorphic matrix I/O classes (i.e. <code>MatrixReader</code> and <code>MatrixWriter</code>) are now gone, replaced by template functions <code><a class="el" href="namespaceloos.html#7ca6d958f9e7c5cc09aab9527d21aef1" title="Write a submatrix to a stream.">loos::writeAsciiMatrix()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="namespaceloos.html#ca31ea1a332e67cae3e8674bbf2e6bc3" title="Read in a matrix from a stream returning a newly created matrix.">loos::readAsciiMatrix()</a></code>. The format used is just a block of ASCII data that can be read in my Octave/MATLAB and GnuPlot. These reading and writing functions are in the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceloos.html" title="Namespace for most things not already encapsulated within a class.">loos</a></code> namespace, not the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceloos_1_1_math.html" title="Namespace for math and math-related things in loos.">loos::Math</a></code> namespace. The reason for this is to support the following pattern, <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="keyword">using namespace </span>std;
<span class="keyword">using namespace </span>loos;

<span class="keyword">typedef</span> Math::Matrix&lt;double, Math::Triangular&gt; Matrix;
...
Matrix M;
<a class="code" href="namespaceloos.html#7ca6d958f9e7c5cc09aab9527d21aef1" title="Write a submatrix to a stream.">writeAsciiMatrix</a>(filename, M, <span class="stringliteral">"My matrix"</span>);
</pre></div><p>
Additionally, math functions that were at a global scope, such as <code>angle()</code> and <code>torsion()</code> are now in the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceloos_1_1_math.html" title="Namespace for math and math-related things in loos.">loos::Math</a></code> namespace.<h3><a class="anchor" name="r130_added_changed">
Added or Altered Functionality and Notables</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
There is an issue with tr1::unordered_set in gcc-4.0.1. This the internal data structure used by the sparse matrix policy. To work around this, LOOS will switch to using the GNU provided hash_map if you're using gcc-4.0.1. This is most likely to affect MacOS users running 10.4 and XCode 2.5 and earlier. </li>
<li>
When <code><a class="el" href="namespaceloos.html#972949e22a6fad942704a83051919218" title="Factory function for reading in structure files.">loos::createSystem()</a></code> sees an Amber prmtop file, it will automatically look for a corresponding .inpcrd file and load the coordinates from that. Otherwise, it returns an AtomicGroup sans coordinates. </li>
<li>
The ensemble functions (such as <code><a class="el" href="namespaceloos.html#be25ba2b9027123aca28176782570862" title="Compute the average structure of a set of AtomicGroup objects.">loos::averageStructure()</a></code>) now take a <code>loos::pTraj</code> instead of a reference to a <code><a class="el" href="classloos_1_1_trajectory.html" title="Base-class for polymorphic trajectories.">loos::Trajectory</a>&amp;</code>. </li>
<li>
Many of the tools now use the boost program_options library </li>
<li>
The alignment tool (<code>aligner</code>) now writes out the average structure as well, and has an option to center the aligned trajectory. </li>
<li>
Added <code>subsetter</code> tool that pulls a subset of a model out of a trajectory into a new, smaller trajectory. </li>
<li>
The <code>PDB</code> reader now only emits warnings for each unique unknown record read rather than a whole mess of 'em... </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r130_bugs">
Bug Fixes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed a bug in the Amber trajectory reader that caused LOOS to incorrectly seek frames. This affected using readFrame(i) but not readFrame(). </li>
<li>
<code>AtomicGroup::splitByMolecule()</code> now handles groups without connectivity. </li>
<li>
Fixed a problem with the PDB reading code that mangled wide CONECT records. </li>

<h2><a class="anchor" name="release120">
Version 1.2.0 (10-24-2008)</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r120_changes">
Changes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Added <code>helix_kink</code> tool to determine bend-angles in helices. </li>
<li>
Added <code>HeavySolventSelector</code> </li>
<li>
Updated tools to use new convenience/factory functions, also making them a tad more universal in what inputs they can take. </li>
<li>
Added <code>AtomicGroup::clearBonds()</code> to remove connectivity in a group. </li>
<li>
<code>PDB</code> will out write out CONECT records when there are 10K atoms or greater, to prevent field overflow. </li>
<li>
<code>Coord&lt;T&gt;</code> can now extract itself from a stream. </li>
<li>
Added <code><a class="el" href="namespaceloos.html#01ad12706a6b9884cc8f3a5677a899e3" title="Applies a string-based selection to an atomic group...">loos::selectAtoms()</a></code> to parse a selection string and apply it to an <code>AtomicGroup</code>. </li>
<li>
Added support for writing out <code>PDB</code> CONECT records.<p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r120_bugs">
Bug Fixes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed problem with <code>PDB</code> output when there are more than 10K residues </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in <code>DCDWriter</code> that caused the output periodic box to be set to (1,1,1) regardless of what was passed in. </li>
<li>
Fixed problem when writing a <code>PDB</code> with bonds to missing atoms. Bonds are now dereferenced prior to writing. This means that the <code>PDB</code> is now no longer const when written and could be sorted. </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in width of CONECT record fields </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in <code>DCD</code> trajectories affecting seeking frames </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in <code>DCD</code> trajectories potentially affecting the number of frames sensed in a trajectory that comes from NAMD. </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in <code>Atom::checkProperty()</code> that caused erroneous results. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="anchor" name="release110">
Version 1.1.0 (9-12-2008)</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r110_changes">
Changes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Major reorganization of the <code>Trajectory</code> class using a template pattern. </li>
<li>
Added <code>CCPDB</code> class for concatenated PDBs that you can treat as a <code>Trajectory</code> </li>
<li>
Added <code>PDBTraj</code> class for handling non-contiguous PDB trajectories </li>
<li>
Added <code>TinkerArc</code> class for TinkerArc (concatenated XYZ files) trajectories </li>
<li>
Changed <code>Atom</code> defaults to initialize atomid and resid to 1 rather than -1 </li>
<li>
Added tool to compute the RMSD between a selection and its average structure over the course of a trajectory </li>
<li>
Improved self-tests </li>
<li>
Added a new tool to reimage a trajectory by molecule </li>
<li>
Added <code>AtomicGroup::apply()</code> to call a functor or a function pointer on each <code>Atom</code> in an <code>AtomicGroup</code>. </li>
<li>
<code>DCDWriter</code> now long requires you to specify how many frames will be written--you can append and it will automatically update the header correctly. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="r110_bugs">
Bug Fixes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed problem with typedefs in MacOS 10.5 </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in <code>ATom</code> where setting coords using a <code>GCoord</code> ref not correctly setting the coords-bit. </li>
<li>
Fixed big in <code>aligner</code> where the first frame of the DCD was not transformed. </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in <code>AtomicGroup::splitByMolecule()</code> where the <code>PeriodicBox</code> was not propagated beyond the first group split. </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in <code>svdcolmap</code> tool that affected certain instances of using atomid maps. </li>
<li>
Fixed bug in <code><a class="el" href="namespaceloos.html#0084e9b3f9fb691e1ad6af8c5e78f45b" title="Compute an iterative superposition (a la Alan).">loos::iterativeAlignment()</a></code> where the returned <code>XForms</code> were incorrect. The passed ensemble of <code>AtomicGroup</code> objects were correctly transformed, but anything that used the <code>XForms</code> were affected by varying degrees. </li>
