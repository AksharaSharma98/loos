<h1><a class="anchor" name="tools">Summary of Tools </a></h1>Below is a summary of the tools currently distributed with LOOS. To get a detailed summary of the command line arguments, run the program without arguments or using "-h". A growing number of tools also support the "--fullhelp" options, which will display more detailed help information including examples of how to use the tool. All of the tools are now package agnostic, in the sense that they will take any of the file formats supported by LOOS as input.<p>
At present, LOOS assumes that all periodic boxes are rectangular, and will produce incorrect answers if trajectories using different box shapes (eg truncated octahedron) are used in programs which make use of periodicity (eg rdf). We have no immediate plans to generalize the code to handle other periodicities, but are willing to reconsider if there is significant demand from users.<p>

<dd>This tool computes the number of contacts between a probe selection and a set of target selections. The output is in the form of a matrix and can be normalized by either total number of contacts (across the row) or by the maximum # of contacts per target (down the column). In addition, it can automatically split the probe into separate molecules, based on their segids, and compute the inter-probe contacts as well.<p>

</dd>
<dt><b>exposure</b> </dt>
<dd>Computes the degree of exposure of a set of selections over time. The exposure is defined as the average density of a probe selection within a spherical shell about each target atom. This tool can be used to determine how exposed to solvent a selection is, or alternatively how buried a selection is.<p>

<dd>Extract a frame from a trajectory and write it as a pdb file.<p>

</dd>
<dt><b>interdist</b> </dt>
<dd>Calculates distances between a selection and an aribtrary set of other selections over a trajectory. The distance computed can be the distance between the centroids, the minimum distance between any atom in any group, or the max distance between any atom in any group.<p>

<dt><b>model2matlab</b> </dt>
<dd>Takes a PDB and a selection and an optional selection and writes out the coordinates to stdout in matlab format.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>octavex</b> </dt>
<dd>Extract embedded OCTAVE data from a LOOS output/log. This is used with aligner.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>order_params</b> </dt>
<dd>Compute the deuterium quadrupolar splitting order parameters for lipid molecules. The model file must have connectivity information.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>paxes</b> </dt>
<dd>Computes the magnitude of the principal axes of a set of selections over the trajectory. This can be used to analyze shape changes over time.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>porcupine</b> </dt>
<dd>Creates a faux-PDB containing atoms/bonds that represent a "porcupine" figure for a column vector from a matrix. This can be used to visualize the direction of motion from SVD and ENM results.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>ramachandran</b> </dt>
<dd>Computes a ramachandran map for a given selection of a specified range of frames in a trajectory (or all frames). Note that some torsions may be missing for the residues at the ends of the selection. To avoid this, expand your selection by a residue in both directions, then use the "--skip" flag.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>rdf</b> </dt>
<dd>Loop over a trajectory file and compute the radial distribution function for two selections. The selections are split up by molecule and the center of mass is used. For example, selecting all water molecules will cause it to compute the radial distribution of the centers of mass of individual water molecules. For contrast, see atomic-rdf.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>rebond</b> </dt>
<dd>Distance-based search for bonds, that are explicitly added to the output PDB. Use this tool to visualize your ENM networks, or to reconnect CA traces from SVD results...<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>recenter-trj</b> </dt>
<dd>Loop over a trajectory, translating the entire system such that the selected portion remains at the origin, and reimaging the rest on a molecule by molecule basis. It can also just do translations in the z-dimension. The model file must have connectivity information, and the trajectory must have periodic box information. This program writes a DCD file as output.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>reimage-by-molecule</b> </dt>
<dd>Reads a trajectory, and writes a new DCD which has been reimaged on a molecule by molecule basis. The model file must have connectivity information, and the trajectory must have periodic box information.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>renum-pdb</b> </dt>
<dd>Used primarily to renumber atoms/residues in a PDB...but it can work with any LOOS-supported format.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>rgyr</b> </dt>
<dd>Loop over a trajectory and compute the radius of gyration for a selection of atoms. Optionally, it can break your selection into individual molecules, if for example you have multiple solutes in the system.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>rmsd2ref</b> </dt>
<dd>Computes rmsds between a selection and either its average conformation or a reference model, optionally aligning the selection.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>rmsfit</b> </dt>
<dd>Superimpose two structures using Kabsch RMS alignment.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>rmsds</b> </dt>
<dd>Loops over a trajectory and computes the pairwise RMSDs for a selection of atoms.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>rotamer</b> </dt>
<dd>Computes the chi-1 and chi-2 angles for a given selection over an entire trajectory.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>subsetter</b> </dt>
<dd>Subsets a trajectory (stripping out any atoms that don't match the given selection), and writes a new DCD file. Can be used to concatenate trajectories, pull specific frames out, as well as adjusting periodic box information and centering the trajectory on a selection. Since trajectories are often stored in files with an ascending numerical sequence name (i.e. frame_1.dcd, frame_2.dcd, etc), and since the shell globbing doesn't sort these in numerical order, a command such as <pre>subsetter foo model.pdb frame_*.dcd</pre> will not concatenate your frames in the order you want. You can tell subsetter to sort the input trajectories so that they are in numerical order by using the "--sort" flag. For more detailed information, use the "--fullhelp" option with subsetter.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>svd</b> </dt>
<dd>Performs principal component analysis for a trajectory using singular value decomposition, writing out the eigenvalues, left singular vectors (eigenvectors) and the right singular vectors (projection timeseries) as OCTAVE-formatted text files.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>svdcolmap</b> </dt>
<dd>Map the magnitude of a left singular vector onto a PDB file's B-value column. Useful for visualizing which portions of a molecule are mobile for a given SVD mode.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>torsion</b> </dt>
<dd>Given 4 selections, compute the torsion angle for their centroids. This program loops over a trajectory and writes the torsion angle time series.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>traj2dcd</b> </dt>
<dd>Converts a LOOS-supported format to a DCD.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>trajinfo</b> </dt>
<dd>Similar to dcdinfo, but works with generic trajectories. Can report box information and the centroid of a selection. Useful for verifying trajectory header information and extracting the number of frames and atoms in a trajectory.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>xy_rdf</b> </dt>
<dd>Compute a two dimension radial distribution function in the xy plane, splitting the system into upper and lower leaflets. Primarily intended for analyzing lateral organization of lipid-water interfaces.<p>
</dd>
<dt><b>xy_rdf_timeseries</b> </dt>
<dd>Same as xy_rdf, except producing a series of block averages rather than averaging over the whole trajectory. </dd>
