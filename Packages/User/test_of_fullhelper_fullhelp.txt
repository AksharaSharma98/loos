SYNOPSIS

	Calculate a pair-wise RMSD for multiple trajectories
DESCRIPTION

	This tool calculates the pair-wise RMSD between each structure in a multi-trajectory.The ith structure is aligned with the jth structure and the RMSD calculated. This is stored in a matrix, i.e. R(j, i) = d(S_i, S_j).  The block-structure is indicative of sets of similar conformations.  The presence (or lack thereof) of multiple cross-peaks is diagnostic of the sampling quality of a simulation.  Cross-peaks between sub-blocks indicates similar conformations in multiple trajectories.

	The requested subset for each frame is cached in memory for better performance. If the memory used by the cache gets too large, your machine may swap and dramatically slow down.  The tool will try to warn you if this is a possibility.  To use less memory, subsample the trajectory by using --skip or --stride, or use subsetter to pre-process the trajectory.

	This tool can be run in parallel with multiple threads for performance.  The --threads option controls how many threads are used.  The default is 1 (non-parallel).  Setting it to 0 will use as many threads as possible.  Note that if LOOS was built using a multi-threaded math library, then some care should be taken in how many threads are used for this tool, though it is unlikely that there will be a conflict.

EXAMPLES

	multi-rmsds model.pdb sim1.dcd sim2.dcd sim3.dcd >rmsd.asc
This example uses all alpha-carbons and every frame from each trajectory.

	multi-rmsds --threads=8 model.pdb sim1.dcd sim2.dcd sim3.dcd >rmsd.asc
This example uses all alpha-carbons and every frame in the trajectories, run in parallel with 8 threads of execution.

	multi-rmsds --selection backbone --skip=50 --stride=10 model.pdb sim1.dcd sim2.dcd sim3.dcd >rmsds.asc This example uses the backbone atoms, and skips the first 50 frames from each trajectory, and only takes every 10th subsequent frame from each trajectory.
