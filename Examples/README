		  *** USING LOOS WITH YOUR CODE ***

This directory is intended to be a template for getting you started
with using LOOS with either SCons or Make.  The bundled program,
'center-pdb' is the LOOS way of saying "hello world!"  

* Using SCons

To use SCons, you need to tell SCons where to find LOOS.  One way to
do this is to copy the 'custom-proto.py' to 'custom.py' and set the
LOOS variable.  You can also specify the location the command line,
i.e.
	scons LOOS=/the/path/to/LOOS

If you built LOOS using SCons and had to edit LOOS' custom.py, then
you will need to make similar edits here as well (telling SCons where
things like ATLAS and BOOST are installed).

With that out of the way, to add new programs to build, simply edit
the SConscript file and run "scons".

* Using Make

To use make with LOOS, you will need to edit the Makefile.  First off,
tell the compiler where LOOS is by changing the LOOS variable.  You
will need to edit the next couple of lines to specify the compiler and
what release or debugging options to use.  If you're building under
Linux, use the next block of lines.  If you're using MacOS X, then
comment out the Linux lines and uncomment the OS X lines.  In either
case, you may need to adjust the locations those variables point to...
