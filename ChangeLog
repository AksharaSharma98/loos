==============================================================================

* BUG FIXES
  ---------

o [build] Fixed problem with LOOS-wide typedefs affecting MacOS 10.5

o [minor] Fixed bug in Atom class where setting coordinates using a GCoord ref
  wont correctly set the coords-bit, i.e.  "foo.coords() = c;" will
  not register that the coords have been set.

o [moderate] Fixed a bug in AtomicGroup::splitByMolecule() where the PeriodicBox
  was not propagated beyond the first group split.

o [moderate] Fixed a bug in Tools/svdcolmap in how the atom maps are
  handled.

o [minor] Fixed a bug in aligner where the first frame of the output
  DCD was not transformed.

o [severe] Fixed a bug affecting the vector<XForms> returned by
  loos::iterativeAlignment().  The passed ensemble is correctly
  aligned and transformed, but the returned XForms were incorrect.
  This could affect anything using them to varying degrees.

* NEW & IMPROVED
  --------------

o Improved self-tests for Matrix44 class and alignment routines.

o Added support for log-scaling magnitudes mapped onto B-values by
  svdcolmap.

o Added a new tool to reimage a DCD by molecule.
