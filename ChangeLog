	* Fixed bug in crossing-waters tool where the entry side of the
	water was never set.

2008-10-31    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	* Fixed bug in Atom::clearPropertyBit() that caused it to
	incorrectly toggle other bits (and not always clear the bit it
	meant to).  This primarily affected the aligner tool.

2008-10-27    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	* Changed the internal has used in LOOS from SGI's hash_set to
	tr1::unordered_set.  This means that any code that relied on loos
	automatically included ext/hash_set will now need to either switch
	to using the tr1 equivalent, or explicitly include the hash_set
	header...

2008-10-23  Tod Romo  <tromo@gorgoneion.urmc-sh.rochester.edu>

	* Added helix_kink tool
	* Fixed problem with PDB output with 10,000 residues or more
	* Fixed problem with automatically using loos namespace.  LOOS
	clients should either use fully qualified names for things in the
	loos namespace, or add a "using namespase loos" statement.
	* Added HeavySolventSelector to get non-hydrogen water atoms
	* Changed tools to use new convenience functions and factory
	functions.

2008-10-21    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	* Updated contacts to use any model filetype and any trajectory type.

2008-10-20    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	* Fixed MAJOR bug in DCDWriter that caused output periodic box
	sizes be set to (1,1,1).

2008-10-15    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	* Added AtomicGroup::clearBonds() to wipe out connectivity in a group.
	* Fixed problem in writing PDBs with bonds to missing atoms.
	Bonds are now deferenced prior to writing.  NOTE that this now
	means the PDB is no longer const when written and it will be sorted...

2008-10-14    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	* Fixed bug in width of CONECT record fields
	* Added check in PDB output to not append CONECT records if there
	are atomid's >99999 to prevent field overflow.
	* Added rudimentary support for extracting a Coord<T> from a stream.
	* Fixed bug in DCD trajectories affecting seeking frames
	* Fixed bug in DCD trajectories potentially affecting reading the
	number of frames in a trajectory that comes from NAMD.

2008-09-30    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	* Changed AtomicGroup::select() to be a const function
	* Added loos::selectAtoms() to parse a selection string and apply
	it to an AtomicGroup.

2008-09-19    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	* Added support for writing out CONECT records for PDBs
	* Fixed bug in Atom::checkProperty() that caused erroneous results

2008-09-08    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	* Added autocorrelation function to time-series class (Alan)

	* Added tool to compute probability dbn of radius of gyration (Alan)

	* Changed rmsd2avg tool to rmsd2ref tool since it now supports
	using an external reference structure.

	* Fixed another small bug in iterative alignment that affects
	groups that were not already close to their centroid.

2008-08-11    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	* Major reorganization of Trajectory class.  The class now uses a
	template pattern for reading frames in addition to being an
	interface.  This makes it even easier to extend.  See the Docs for
	more details.

	* Added CCPDB class for ConCatenated PDBs.  You can now treat
	these as a Trajectory.

	* Added PDBTraj class for handling non-contiguous PDBs as a
	trajectory.  Provide it with a printf-style format for generating
	frame names and a range of frame numbers to use, and it will allow
	you to access them as a Trajectory.

	* Added TinkerArc class for treating TinkerArc files (concatenated
	XYZ files) as a Trajectory.

	* Fixed problem with namespace collision with Boost in
	Tools/svd.cpp

	* Changed Atom defaults to initialize atomid and resid to 1,
	rather than -1.

2008-08-05    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	* Added tool to compute the RMSD between a selection and its
	average structure over the course of a trajectory.

2008-08-04    <tromo@spade.biophysics.rochester.edu>

	= BUGS =
	
	* Fixed problem with LOOS-wide typedefs affecting MacOS 10.5

	* Fixed minor bugin Atom class where setting coordinates using a
	GCoord ref doesn't correctly set the coords-bit,
	i.e. "foo.coords() = c;" will not register that the coords have
	been set.

	* Fixed minor bug in Tools/aligner where the first frame of the
	output DCD was not transformed.

	* Fixed moderate bug in AtomicGroup::splitByMolecule() where the
	PeriodicBox was not propagated beyond the first group split.

	* Fixed moderate bug in Tools/svdcolmap that affected certain
	instances of using atomid maps.

	* Fixed severe bug in loos::iterativeAlignment() where the
	returned vector<XForms> were incorrect.  The passed ensemble of
	AtomicGroups were correctly transformed, but anything that used
	the XForms would be affected to varying degrees.

	= NEW & IMPROVED =
	
	* Added improved self-tests for alignment routines.

	* Added support for log-scaling magnitudes in Tools/svdcolmap.

	* Added a new tool to reimage a DCD by molecule.

	* Added AtomicGroup::apply() to call a functor or function pointer
	on each Atom in an AtomicGroup.

	* Changed dcdwriter so that it no longer requires you to specify
	the number of frames that will be written.  Instead, it will
	automatically update the header with the current number of frames
	and then append the frame to the end of the trajectory.
