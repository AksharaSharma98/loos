	* Major reorganization of Trajectory class.  The class now uses a
	template pattern for reading frames in addition to being an
	interface.  This makes it even easier to extend.  See the Docs for
	more details.

	* Added CCPDB class for ConCatenated PDBs.  You can now treat
	these as a Trajectory.

	* Added PDBTraj class for handling non-contiguous PDBs as a
	trajectory.  Provide it with a printf-style format for generating
	frame names and a range of frame numbers to use, and it will allow
	you to access them as a Trajectory.

	* Added TinkerArc class for treating TinkerArc files (concatenated
	XYZ files) as a Trajectory.

	* Fixed problem with namespace collision with Boost in
	Tools/svd.cpp

	* Changed Atom defaults to initialize atomid and resid to 1,
	rather than -1.

	* Added tool to compute the RMSD between a selection and its
	average structure over the course of a trajectory.

	* Fixed problem with LOOS-wide typedefs affecting MacOS 10.5

	* Fixed minor bugin Atom class where setting coordinates using a
	GCoord ref doesn't correctly set the coords-bit,
	i.e. "foo.coords() = c;" will not register that the coords have
	been set.

	* Fixed minor bug in Tools/aligner where the first frame of the
	output DCD was not transformed.

	* Fixed moderate bug in AtomicGroup::splitByMolecule() where the
	PeriodicBox was not propagated beyond the first group split.

	* Fixed moderate bug in Tools/svdcolmap that affected certain
	instances of using atomid maps.

	* Fixed severe bug in loos::iterativeAlignment() where the
	returned vector<XForms> were incorrect.  The passed ensemble of
	AtomicGroups were correctly transformed, but anything that used
	the XForms would be affected to varying degrees.

	* Added improved self-tests for alignment routines.

	* Added support for log-scaling magnitudes in Tools/svdcolmap.

	* Added a new tool to reimage a DCD by molecule.

	* Added AtomicGroup::apply() to call a functor or function pointer
	on each Atom in an AtomicGroup.

	* Changed dcdwriter so that it no longer requires you to specify
	the number of frames that will be written.  Instead, it will
	automatically update the header with the current number of frames
	and then append the frame to the end of the trajectory.
