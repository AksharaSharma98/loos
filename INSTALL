Building and Installing Loos
----------------------------

*** FOR THE IMPATIENT ***

= Fedora =

   scons release=1
   sudo scons release=1 install

Note: LOOS requires ATLAS and BOOST.  You can install both via the
"yum" package manager.  You will need to install both the basic
package and the devel package, i.e.
	yum install boost.x86_64
	yum install boost-devel.x86_64


= Ubuntu =

You will need to install atlas, boost, and SCons.  LOOS has been
tested with atlas3-sse2-devel and boost-devel installed under the
latest Ubuntu.  You will need to use a custom.py file to change where
atlas and lapack are for LOOS.  Copy the custom.py-proto to
custom.py and edit it.  Change the LAPACK and ATLAS variables to
the following:
    LAPACK='/usr/lib/sse2/atlas'
    ATLAS='/usr/lib/sse2'

= MACOS X (10.4+) =

First, make sure you have the Developer's Tools (i.e. XCode)
installed.  You can find it on your MacOS X install disk or,
alternatively, you can sign up for a free account with the Apple
Developer's Connection and download the latest version.  Next, you
will need to install SCons and BOOST.  If all went well, you should be
able to cd to where you have the LOOS source and run "scons release=1".




*** FOR THE LESS IMPATIENT ***

= LINUX =

You will need to have ATLAS and BOOST installed, including the BOOST
libraries.  You will also need SCons to build the software and,
optionally, Doxygen to regenerate the documentation.  Use your
favorite package manager to install these components, or download and
build them.

You will probably need to create a custom.py file to tell LOOS where
the required compenents are.  There is a template custom.py file
already as part of LOOS.  Copy this,
	cp custom.py-proto custom.py

Now edit this file.  Follow the comments to figure out what variables
need to be changed.  In particular, note that the names of the BOOST
libraries will change (i.e. BOOSTREGEX and BOOSTPO)

Now you're ready to build...
    scons release=1

-or- if you have 4 cores,
     scons -j4 release=1

If you want to install LOOS, use the install target,
   scons release=1 install

The default installation location is in /opt/loos.  You can change
this by either setting PREFIX in your custom.py file, or specifying it
on the command line, i.e.
   scons release=1 PREFIX=/usr/local/loos-latest install

The recommended installation methodology is to install LOOS into a
version-specific directory, and then set up a symlink from
"loos-latest" to the most recent installed version:

   scons PREFIX=/opt/loos-1.5.2 install
   ln -s /opt/loos-1.5.2 /opt/loos-latest

= MAC OS X =

If LOOS does not build after following the "quick" instructions above
for MacOS, check to see if the boost libraries are named based on your
compiler and boost version, i.e. libboost_regex-gcc43.a rather than
libboost_regex.a.  If this is the case, copy the custom.py,
   cp custom.py-proto custom.py
and then edit it to change the BOOSTREGEX and BOOSTPO variables to
point to the correct library name.
