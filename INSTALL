Building and Installing Loos
----------------------------

*** FOR THE IMPATIENT ***

= Fedora Core =

   scons release=1
   sudo scons release=1 install

Note: LOOS requires ATLAS and BOOST.  You can install both via the
"yum" package manager.  You will need to install both the basic
package and the devel package, i.e.
	yum install boost.x86_64
	yum install boost-devel.x86_64


*** FOR THE LESS IMPATIENT ***

= LINUX =

You will need to have ATLAS and BOOST installed, including the BOOST
libraries.  You will also need SCons to build the software and,
optionally, Doxygen to regenerate the documentation.  Use your
favorite package manager to install these components, or download and
build them.

You will probably need to create a custom.py file to tell LOOS where
the required compenents are.  There is a template custom.py file
already as part of LOOS.  Copy this,
	cp custom.py-proto custom.py

Now edit this file.  Follow the comments to figure out what variables
need to be changed.  In particular, note that the names of the BOOST
libraries will change (i.e. BOOSTREGEX and BOOSTPO)

Now you're ready to build...
    scons release=1

-or- if you have 4 cores,
     scons -j4 release=1

If you want to install LOOS, use the install target,
   scons release=1 install

The default installation location is in /opt/loos.  You can change
this by either setting PREFIX in your custom.py file, or specifying it
on the command line, i.e.
   scons release=1 PREFIX=/usr/local/loos-latest install

= MAC OS X =

Follow the instructions for LINUX above, but omit ATLAS.  You will, at
a minimum, need the developer's tools installed along with BOOST.
